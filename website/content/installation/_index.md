PymaxMusic contains both a Python package and a Max package, both of which need to be installed. Pymax uses CNMATâ€™s [osc4py3](https://pypi.org/project/osc4py3/) library, which you need to install before using.  

#### To install the Python package:

Install osc4py3:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Windows" %}}
```Bash
py -m pip install osc4py3
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="Mac or Linux" %}}
```Bash
python3 -m pip install osc4py3
